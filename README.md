# Pearl Hacks 2021 - Encourance 🧘

## Inspiration 💡
Learning and working remotely for the past year has taught us 
that balancing our professional and personal life can be difficult, but it's essential. A good work-life balance has numerous positive effects, such as a lower risk of burnout and a better sense of well-being. Encourance is aimed to foster its users' state of equilibrium by tracking their progress of meditation. 

## What it does 💻
It is easy to get lost in our busy schedules and everyday responsibilities that we often forget to take a break and breathe. Our mission is to shine light on the importance of mindfulness in regards of mental health wellness

### Timer
Encourance consists of a meditation timer that the user can set
for how many hours/minutes they wish to practice meditation. 
The activity on the timer feature would be stored into a database
and showcased in the user's profile.
### Profile
The profile page showcases the user's meditation statistics:
the total number of hours they meditated in the current week and day, as well as and the total number of meditation sessions and hours overall.
### Resources
The resources section showcases mental health resources and 
meditation practical tools and daily practices. 

## How we built it ⚙️
We built Encourance using HTML5 and CSS for the front end,
Python (Flask) and JavaScript for the back end, as well as GitHub and VSCode (LiveShare) for source code management.

## Challenges we ran into 🦟
It is our first time attending a hackathon, so there were 
a lot of challenges on the way. The biggest challenge was 
setting up with flask and learning how to style with CSS along the way.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 🏆
Our team had little to no experience with web development, so 
we are proud that we have a functional website up and running with a responsive and engaging user interface! Overall, we are proud that we learned web development fundamentals using Flask with CSS and HTML in less than 2 hours. 

## What we learned 📖
We learned how to with code in flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as how to collaborate through a GitHub repository.
